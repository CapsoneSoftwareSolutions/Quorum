## Quick start

#### Installation 


##### Requirements

+ Django==1.5.4
+ django-crispy-forms
+ django-haystack
+ Whoosh



##### Create virtual env and activate it(optional)

    virtualenv --no-site-packages quorumenv
    source quorumenv/bin/activate

#### Edit `settings.py`

##### Add `crispy_forms`,`quorum`, `registration`, `haystack` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
          ...
          ...
        'crispy_forms',
        'quorum',
        'registration',
        'haystack',
          ...
          ...        	
    )

    #crispy template tag settings
    CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap'

    LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/quorum/'

##### Add request context processor

    from django.conf.global_settings import TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS += (

    	......

    	'django.core.context_processors.request',
    	'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',

    	.....
    )


if there isn't any `TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS` variable in settings.py then import and append it:

    from django.conf.global_settings import TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS += ('django.core.context_processors.request',)

##### set Database and Staticfiles

    import os
    PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
    DEBUG = True
    TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG

    dbpath=PROJECT_DIR
    STATICFILES_DIRS = (os.path.join(PROJECT_DIR,'..','..', 'static'),)

    ........

    DATABASES = {
    	'default': {
    		'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', # Add 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.
    		'NAME':  os.path.join(dbpath, 'sqlite3.db'), # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
    		'USER': '',
    		'PASSWORD': '',
    		'HOST': '', # Empty for localhost through domain sockets or '127.0.0.1' for localhost through TCP.
    		'PORT': '', # Set to empty string for default.
    	}
    }

    .......

    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(PROJECT_DIR, '..', 'static')

    

Run the `collectstatic` management command:

    python manage.py collectstatic

This will copy all files from `quorum/static` folders into the `STATIC_ROOT` directory.


#### Edit the URLconf

Include the `quorum` and `accounts` URLconf in your project `urls.py` like this::
    
    urlpatterns = patterns('',
    	.............
    	.............

        url(r'^quorum/', include('quorum.urls')),
        url(r'^accounts/', include('registration.urls')),
        url(r'^users/(?P<username>\w+)/$', 'quorum.views.quorumuser'),
        url(r'^search/', include('haystack.urls')),

        ................
        ...............
    )

    from haystack.query import SearchQuerySet
    sqs = SearchQuerySet()
    from haystack.views import SearchView, search_view_factory
    urlpatterns += patterns('haystack.views',

    	url(r'^quorum/search/$', search_view_factory(
    		view_class=SearchView,
    		template='quorum/search.html',
    		searchqueryset=sqs,
    		),
    	name='haystack_search'),
    )


#### HAYSTACK_CONNECTIONS

This setting controls which backends should be available. It should be a dictionary of dictionaries resembling the following..


	HAYSTACK_CONNECTIONS = {
		'default': {
			'ENGINE': 'haystack.backends.whoosh_backend.WhooshEngine',
			'PATH': os.path.join(dbpath, 'whoosh_index'),
		},
	}


#### Run the site.

`python manage.py syncdb` to create the models. 

Then start the development server(`python manage.py runserver`) and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/quorum.


#### Add sample data

open python console by typing `python manage.py shell`

on console :

    >>> from quorum import sampledata
    >>> sampledata.initd()
    >>> exit()
